SCALE Framework

The SCALE Framework is an open framework for building stronger, more efficient small-to-medium businesses. It provides a structured way to simplify operations, align teams, and drive sustainable growth.

This repo is free to use, adapt, and improve.

📚 What is SCALE?

SCALE is built around five practical steps:

S – Simplify: Eliminate unnecessary complexity.

C – Clarify: Define goals, roles, and processes.

A – Align: Sync people, systems, and strategy.

L – Leverage: Use tools, data, and resources effectively.

E – Execute: Turn plans into consistent results.
